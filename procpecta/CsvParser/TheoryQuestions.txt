Tackling the Challenge

    Parse the CSV: Read the CSV data using BufferedReader and store it in a map.

    Evaluate Formulas: Iterate through the map to resolve and calculate formulas, ensuring dependencies are handled.

    Write to Excel: Write the final data to an Excel file using Apache POI.

Types of Errors to Check For

    File Not Found: Ensure the input CSV file path is correct.

    Invalid Format: Validate that CSV entries follow the expected key: value format.

    Circular References: Prevent infinite loops by checking for circular dependencies in formulas.

    Null Values: Handle cases where expected references in formulas are not present.

How a User Might Break the Code

    Incorrect CSV Format: Providing a CSV file that doesn't match the expected key: value format.

    Circular Formulas: Adding formulas that reference each other circularly, leading to infinite loops.

    Missing Dependencies: Including formulas that reference non-existent or misspelled keys.

    Special Characters: Using unexpected characters in the CSV that might not be properly handled by the parsing logic.
